## Purpose
Define how the Node SDK accepts and applies caller configuration so client initialization stays explicit, TypeScript-idiomatic, and aligned with the underlying API contract.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Node SDK configuration must be explicit before use
The Node SDK MUST require the configuration values needed to initialize its client behavior before authenticated operations are attempted, including the values needed to drive auth/session behavior.

#### Scenario: Attempting to use the SDK without configuration
- **WHEN** a caller invokes authenticated Node SDK behavior before providing the required configuration
- **THEN** the SDK throws an `UnconfiguredError`

#### Scenario: Providing configuration for auth/session behavior
- **WHEN** a caller constructs `new Config({ applicationKey: ... })` and passes it to the SDK
- **THEN** the Node SDK has the configuration needed to apply its documented authentication and session lifecycle behavior

### Requirement: Node SDK configuration must remain TypeScript-idiomatic and free of environment-variable magic
The Node SDK MUST expose configuration only through explicit constructor arguments, with no implicit environment-variable or config-file loading, matching the Rust SDK's configuration model.

#### Scenario: Configuring a custom API endpoint
- **WHEN** a caller constructs `new Config({ applicationKey: ..., baseUrl: ... })`
- **THEN** the SDK applies that base URL for all subsequent requests instead of the default

#### Scenario: No environment-variable fallback exists
- **WHEN** a caller does not pass `applicationKey` explicitly
- **THEN** the SDK does not attempt to read one from `process.env` or a config file — construction fails a TypeScript compile-time check for the missing required property

### Requirement: Node SDK ships the API contract as a submodule for traceability
The Node SDK MUST include `API/openapi.yaml` (the `dtrpg-api` submodule) in the repository so the package has a direct, verifiable dependency on the same API contract used by the other SDKs.

#### Scenario: Building the Node SDK from source
- **WHEN** a contributor clones `dtrpg-sdk.js` with submodules
- **THEN** `API/openapi.yaml` is present and can be diffed against the contract other SDKs consume
