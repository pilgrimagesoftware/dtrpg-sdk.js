# Release Process

Versioning and the changelog are both derived from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
history via [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org), configured in [cliff.toml](cliff.toml).

## Cutting a release

```sh
git checkout develop
git pull
```

Trigger the **Prepare Release** workflow (`workflow_dispatch` in the Actions tab). It:

1. Runs `git-cliff --bump` against `develop` to determine the next version from commits since the last tag.
2. Updates `package.json` to that version via `npm version --no-git-tag-version`.
3. Prepends the generated changelog section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Opens a pull request from an auto-created `release/<version>` branch into `master`.

Review the PR, merge into `master`, then merge the same changes back into `develop`. Tag the release:

```sh
git checkout master
git pull
git tag -a v<version> -m "Release <version>"
git push origin v<version>
```

The tag push triggers the **Release** workflow, which tests, builds, publishes to npm with provenance, and creates
the GitHub Release with the changelog for that tag attached.

## Hotfixes

For an urgent fix to what's currently in production:

```sh
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b hotfix/<description>
# fix, bump patch version, commit
```

PR into `master`, merge, tag, which triggers the release workflow. Then PR the same branch into `develop` so the
fix isn't lost on the next regular release.

## Secrets

- `NPM_TOKEN` — a repo secret with publish access to the `@pilgrimagesoftware/dtrpg-sdk` package on npm,
  used by the Release workflow's `npm publish` step. Must be a token with permission to publish under the
  `pilgrimagesoftware` npm org (first publish of a scoped package requires org publish rights, not just a
  package-scoped automation token).
